## Description
Topic: Diabetes burden across United States
This project examines the prevalence and distribution of diabetes across the United States using multiple datasets from Kaggle and the CDC. The goal is to visualize geographic and temporal patterns of diabetes, explore correlations with behavioral risk factors such as obesity and physical inactivity. The aim is to communicate how lifestyle factors and demographics contribute to diabetes prevalence. 
## Data Sources
### Data Source 1:  Kaggle – Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset Notebook 
URL https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset-notebook 
Size: 253,680 rows, 22 columns
This dataset is based on the CDC’s 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey and includes self-reported health indicators such as BMI, smoking, physical activity, blood pressure, cholesterol, and general health status. Each record represents an individual respondent, with a binary variable indicating diabetes diagnosis.
### Data Source 2:  Diabetes Prevalence Data
URL https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sirishasingla1906/diabetes-prevalence-data?resource=download&select=diabetes.csv 
Size: 3144 rows and 14 columns 
Description: 
The dataset provides comprehensive insights into diabetes and obesity prevalence across various U.S. states and counties. It includes valuable numeric data and percentages, offering a perspective on men's and women's health indicators. 
### Data Source 3:  CDC Diabetes Atlas
URL: https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/diabetes/diabetesatlas-analysis.html# 
Size: subject to filtering, 6 columns
The CDC Diabetes Atlas provides official data for diagnosed diabetes patients by US state and county. This dataset provides temporal and geographic variations. I will be filtering it based by state, and other indicators for a complete narrative. 
## Questions
1. Will a specific kind of visualization ( for example a heatmap)  be required for the final layout? 
2. I noticed a there was a lot of writing in the previous projects, are we expected to write the narrative and analysis entirely ourselves or can we reference and adapt certain information from external sources such as articles, CDC reports or maybe AI?
